# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This is a piece of software I created as my final project for A-Level Computer Science when I was 18.

Included in the files is the ~28,000 word "Project Report" I submitted for assessment for which I received full marks. This heavily contributed to my A* for A-Level Computer Science.

It includes web scraping and machine learning allowing users to evaluate the the feelings expressed by Twitter users towards a specific topic. It can be used by companies to track what people are tweeting about their company and what emotions people are generally feeling towards their company as means to assess public perception. Users can track sentiment over time which is stored in a local database.

## Disclaimer
This was developed before my enrolment as a Computer Science undergraduate (2020/2021) and so the quality of code may not be representitive of what I am now capable of as a software engineer. The use of git version control was very limited during this project and the quality of the report is lacking due to the use of MS Word instead of LaTeX.
